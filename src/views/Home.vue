              In the last decade, numerous sociotechnical developments have been
              under way to make visible who is travelling to Europe. While
              research on technologies of bordering tends to focus on the
              invisibility of people, less attention has been given to the
              invisibility of those data infrastructures that allow the
              informational management of mobility, migration and borders. Yet
              bringing such data infrastructures to the foreground is paramount,
              as they have a major role in how people on the move are not only
              represented, but enacted, with long-term consequences for their
              future life chances.
            </p>

            <p>
              The ontology explorer is a method and tool that moves a step
              towards addressing the invisibility of data infrastructures used
              at the border. Drawing on scholarship on data infrastructures and
              classifications in the social studies of technology (STS), the
              method and tool allows to semantically compare the ontologies
              implemented in diverse information systems used to identify people
              at borders.
            </p>

            <p>
              This methodol and tool aims to answer a broad set of research
              questions about how people on the move are enacted through diverse
              data infrastructures, and how authorities and countries differ in
              the way they enact them
