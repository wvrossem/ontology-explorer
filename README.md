# Ontology graph and map explorer

In atlas.ti we have the following data types

- Documents & Document Groups
- Quotes
- Codes and code groups

To do:

- A document group should be linked to (one or more) locations (gps coordinates?)
- Quotes give the actual value => could be used to process and find the linkages => if turned into a simple framework I could start with simple Lehvenstein distance and allow it to be open for other methods such as multilingual linking
- Multiple levels
  - Categories and their values
  - Groupings from the schema
  - Our own groupings
- Possible grouping/styling rules
  - Possible to make nodes with more connections larger?
  - Different colour between attributes and attr. values?
