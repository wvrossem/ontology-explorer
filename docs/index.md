# The Ontology Explorer documentation

Welcome to the documentation for Ontology Explorer! This documentation provides guidance on installation, usage, and background information on the technical architecture of the project.

This documentation is inspired by the “Diátaxis documentation framework” by Daniele Procida (see <https://diataxis.fr/>).

## Tutorial

* Learn how to start a project on coding EU information systems for migration and border control using the ATLAS.ti software for qualitative data analysis with [this tutorial](tutorial-atlas.md).
* Learn how to use the Ontology Explorer software tool to analyse a coded ATLAS.ti project by following [this tutorial](tutorial-ontology-explorer.md).

## How-to guides

* **Installation**: Learn how to install the Ontology Explorer by following the steps outlined on the [Installation](installation.md) page.
* **Build**: Find instructions on how to build Ontology Explorer for production on the [Build](build.md) page.
* **Upload**: Learn how to load your Atlas.ti project and prepare it for analysis by following the steps outlined on the [Upload](upload.md) page.
* **Network analysis**: Find instructions on how to perform network analysis on your data models using set operations by following the steps detailed on the [Network Analysis](network-analysis.md) page.
* **Network visualization**: Learn how to visualize the output of the network analysis with the force-directed graph explained on the [Network Visualization](network-visualization.md) page.
* **Export**: Learn how to export the OE analysis output to CSV files for further data analysis and network visualization with Gephi on the [Export](export.md) page.

## Reference

* The [domain models page](domain-model.md) describes the ATLAS.ti and network data models used in the Ontology Explorer.
* A broad overview of the Vue.js application architecture is provided on [this page](architecture.md)
