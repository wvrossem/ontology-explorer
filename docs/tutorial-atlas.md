Welcome to the Ontology Explorer tutorial for analyzing EU regulations related to migration and border control. In this tutorial, you will learn how to create an ATLAS.ti project for importing into the Ontology Explorer. This tutorial serves as a simplified example of how to collect, import, code, and group data describing data models using ATLAS.ti software, similar to what is described in our scientific paper Van Rossem and Pelizza (2022).

ATLAS.ti is a commercial software for qualitative data analysis and a license is required for use. For optimal performance, ATLAS.ti version 8 is recommended. Learn more about ATLAS.ti: <https://atlasti.com/>

## Step 1: Collecting data for data coding in ATLAS.ti

The first step in using the Ontology Explorer is to gather data for analyzing data models. In this tutorial, our focus is on the primary information systems for EU migration and border control, namely the Eurodac system, the Visa Information System, and the Schengen Information System. One way to achieve this is by downloading PDF files of EU regulations on migration and border control from EUR-lex. These regulations specify the categories of data collected by the systems, for example in Article 20 of the VIS regulation, “Categories of data”.

Access the regulations through these links:

* Regulation on the Schengen Information System (SIS): <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32018R1862>
* Regulation on the Visa Information System <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02008R0767-20190611>
* Regulation on the Eurodac system <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32013R0603>

> ℹ️ As we do not have access to the actual data models of these systems, we are using these regulations. Documents reporting data models and their categories of data, that is, the labels describing a state that can assume different values can be very diverse: from regulations to design documents, from screenshots to interview transcripts. You can use any material that is compatible with ATLAS.ti.

## Step 2: Importing and organizing documents into ATLAS.ti, or "document grouping"

Import the downloaded documents into ATLAS.ti software and assign appropriate names within the software for easy reference.

Since the method and tool assume that data describing the data model of a system may be spread across multiple documents, it is necessary to create document groups. For example, create a document group named “SIS” and include the SISII regulation document within it. Do the same for each system.

> ℹ️ You can come up with alternative combinations. One approach could be to group Eurodac and SIS together, and VIS separately, allowing these two groups to serve as analytical categories in the future.

## Step 3: Coding the documents, or "preliminary in vivo coding"

Next, identify and code the "categories of data" found in the regulations documents. Quote and code these categories in-vivo. For example, code the text "surnames" with the code "surnames". Repeat this process for all relevant categories of data in the regulations.

> ℹ️ The practice of in-vivo coding in social science research entails labeling data using participants' own words or phrases. In the Ontology Explorer, we utilize in-vivo coding by using the category name as the code. This method can also be applied to handle category names in different languages.

## Step 4: Grouping codes into code groups, or "code harmonization"

After coding the documents, group the codes into code groups. For instance, while the SIS regulation may refer to "surnames", the VIS regulation might use the term "family name".

Create meta code groups to group similar categories together for analysis. For example, create a code group named "surname" that includes both "surnames" and "family name".

> ℹ️ Remember, the granularity of these code groups depends on the researcher’s aims. The example shows that combining these two codes can also cause information loss, as "SIS" represents the plural form "surnames" and can encompass multiple names.

## Step 5: Completing data coding and exporting

Once the data coding is complete and all codes and documents are grouped, the project is ready for export. Utilize the "File - Export as XML" functionality within the ATLAS.ti software to export the project.

Congratulations! You have successfully learned how prepare an example project for use in the Ontology Explorer tool that can be used to analyze EU regulations related to migration and border control.
